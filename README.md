# py3Dmol
Py3Dmol is a convenient tool for interactive visualization of molecular structures in Python, especially in Jupyter notebooks where you can manipulate and explore the structures interactively. It allows you to visualize molecular structures directly within a Jupyter notebook or in a standalone Python script.

py3Dmol is a Python library that provides a simple way to visualize molecular structures and data ![1bh5_protein_animated](https://github.com/futureomics/py3Dmol/assets/86778349/c4f8af1b-361a-4706-96c5-4c7bd6633a7d)
in 3D using WebGL. It's particularly handy for creating interactive molecular visualizations directly within a Jupyter notebook or a Python script. You can use it to load molecular structures from various file formats, apply different styles and representations, and even overlay additional data onto the visualization.
